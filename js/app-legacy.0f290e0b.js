This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.","source":"From “Muad’Dib: The Religious Issues” by the Princess Irulan","book":"Dune","collection":"Muad\'Dib: The Religious Issues","tags":["Muad\'Dib","Princess Irulan"]},{"text":"When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself.
